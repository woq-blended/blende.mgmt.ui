== Blended Management UI

This project contains the Scala.js project implementing a management console that can be used as a client to a https://github.com/woq-blended/blended[blended] container hosting the blended management REST Api.

The management console is a React application implemented in https://www.scala-js.org/[Scala.js] using http://www.react4s.org[react4s] and the https://material-ui.com/[Material UI react components].

=== Subprojects

The overall project contains several subprojects:

* ```common``` contains reusable objects which may be of use in any Scala.js/react4s application such as a simple logger and internationalization support.

* ```components``` contains reusable higher level React components, such as a ReactTable.

* ```material-gen``` contains a simple generator which reads the ```index.js``` files of Material-UI React and generates simple Scala.js wrappers to use those components in Scala.js / react4s.

* ```material``` uses the generated components and is the place to enrich the Material-API manually to make it more Scala-ish. For now the manual code is around customizing the styles used in Material-Ui-React-Components.

* ```router``` is essentially taken from https://github.com/werk/router4s with some more options for variable paths and some test cases. Once the management console reaches it's final stages the changes will be contributed back to the original project.

* ```mgmt-app``` contains the actual management console.

* ```sampleApp``` contains a sample application that can be used as a playground to test out React Components without breaking the management console. Over time this subproject will become obsolete.

* ```mgmt-app-test``` contains the setup for testing the management console with Selenium. For now it just has a very simple test and the setup. The test performs tests on the management console built wih ```app/fastOptJS/webpack``` and requires the http://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started[SeleniumDriver for Chrome] to be set up correctly. Test can be executed with ```uitest/test```

* ```server``` contains a simple server based on Akka-HTTP which will serve the management console resources via Akka-HTTP. The resulting jar can be deployed into a container which is hosting the blended Akka-HTTP-Server bundle.

=== Building

==== Management console

The fastest way to build the management console ist to start sbt and run ```blendedMgmtUiApp/fastOptJS/webpack```. This will build everything into the directory ```./mgmt-app/target/scala-2.12/scalajs-bundler/main```.


The build process will copy the file ```index-dev.html``` into that directory as well, so the management console can be started by loading the ```index-dev.html``` file in a browser.

[NOTE]
====
In IntelliJ, simply navigate to the ```index-dev.html``` in the directory above and select any of the browser buttons in the top right corner of the editor.
====

The management console requires a running managemen container hosting the REST- and WebSocket API to connect to.

During development you can use sbt in file watching mode with ```~blendedMgmtUiApp/fastOptJS/webpack```, so that the management console is rebuilt and repackaged whenever code changes are saved to disk. After the rebuild ,simply refresh the browser page to load the new version.

==== Server bundle

The server bundle can be built simply with ```blendedMgmtUiServer/packageBin``` to produce the OSGi deployable bundle.

==== Tests

Run ```test``` to execute all Unit- and Selenium-Tests.

=== Publishing locally

Run ```publishLocal``` to publish all relevant artifacts in the local Ivy repository. This is required to use the server bundle in a management container packaging.
